# ECommerceApp

![CI/CD](https://github.com/JakubKopecky-dev/ECommerceApp/actions/workflows/ci-cd.yml/badge.svg)

**ECommerceApp** is a backend e-commerce system built with a microservices architecture, running on **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**.
Each service has a specific domain responsibility and communicates with others via **gRPC**, **MassTransit (Azure Service Bus)**, and **SignalR** for real-time updates.
All external traffic is routed through a centralized **API Gateway** (YARP Reverse Proxy).

## Tech Stack

### Back-end
- .NET 9  
- SignalR  
- gRPC  
- MassTransit, RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus  
- EF Core  
- ASP.NET Core Identity  
- JWT
- YARP API Gateway (API Gateway)  


### Infrastructure
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- Azure SQL
- Azure Service Bus
- Cert-Manager + Let's Encrypt for HTTPS
- NGINX Ingress Controller


### CI/CD Pipeline
The project includes a fully automated CI/CD pipeline using **GitHub Actions**:

- **Build & Test** – On every push to `main` or when opening a pull request, the project is built and all unit and integration tests are executed.  
- **Docker Build & Push** – A Docker image is built for each microservice and pushed to the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).  
- **Deploy** – After a successful build, the images tagged with the commit SHA are automatically deployed to **Azure Kubernetes Service**.  

## Project Structure

### CartService
- Responsible for creating carts, managing cart items, and cart checkout  

### DeliveryService
- Simulates a delivery service with a courier  

### NotificationService
- Responsible for sending notifications to the user  
- Uses SignalR  

### OrderService
- Responsible for creating and managing orders  
- Orchestrates communication with PaymentService, DeliveryService, and NotificationService  

### PaymentService

- Creates checkout URLs and handles Stripe responses after successful payments  

### ProductService
- Responsible for managing products, brands, categories, and reviews  

### UserService
- Responsible for user management, authentication, and JWT generation

### GatewayService
- Acts as the single entry point, routing external requests to the appropriate microservice  


### Tests
- Contains positive and negative xUnit tests for all services and controllers
- All tests are also executed automatically in the CI/CD pipeline
- **301 xUnit tests in total**  
- Integration tests cover critical application flows  
- **29 integration tests in total**  


## Features
- Decoupled microservices communicating via gRPC and RabbitMQ/Azure Service Bus
- Centralized API Gateway (single entry point, routing, reverse proxy)  
- User management  
- User registration and login (JWT authentication)  
- Product, brand, category, and product review management  
- Add products to cart and checkout  
- Payments via Stripe (Checkout Session)  
- Order creation and delivery handling  
- Order and delivery status management  
- Real-time notifications when an order is created, status changes, or delivery is canceled (SignalR)  
- Automated tests (301 xUnit, 29 integration)  

## Stripe
- Integration with the Stripe payment service  
- Checkout URL creation  
- WebHook handling for successful payments  

### Testing in Sandbox Mode
- Test card number for successful payment: `4242424242424242`  
- Other fields can be random values  
- [Stripe Documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart)  

## Running the Project Locally

### Requirements
- .NET 9 SDK  
- Docker + Docker Compose  
- SQL Server database (recommended to run in Docker)  

### Steps

#### 1) Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JakubKopecky-dev/ECommerceApp.git   
cd ECommerceApp
```

#### 2) Run the application using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

#### 3) After starting, the services are available here:
| Service               | URL / Swagger UI |
|------------------------|------------------|
| CartService            | [Swagger](http://localhost:7000/cart/swagger/index.html) |
| DeliveryService        | [Swagger](http://localhost:7000/delivery/swagger/index.html) |
| NotificationService    | [Swagger](http://localhost:7000/notification/swagger/index.html) |
| OrderService           | [Swagger](http://localhost:7000/order/swagger/index.html) |
| PaymentService         | [Swagger](http://localhost:7000/payment/swagger/index.html) |
| ProductService         | [Swagger](http://localhost:7000/product/swagger/index.html) |
| UserService            | [Swagger](http://localhost:7000/user/swagger/index.html) |
| RabbitMQ Management UI | [http://localhost:15672](http://localhost:15672) (user: `guest`, pass: `guest`) |
| SQL Server             | `localhost,1433` (user: `sa`, password: `ECom2025!Pass`) |

#### 4) Configuration
- Configurations are defined in `docker-compose.yml` for local development.

> ⚠️ Credentials (e.g. SQL connection string, JWT key, or Stripe keys) are only for local usage.  
> In production on **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**, sensitive configuration values are stored securely using **Kubernetes Secrets**  
> (e.g. `ecommerce-secrets` and `ghcr-secret`) or managed through **Azure Key Vault** if integrated.

#### 5) Running tests

##### Run all tests
```bash
dotnet test
```

##### Run all unit tests
``` bash
dotnet test --filter Category=Unit
```

##### Run all integration tests
``` bash
dotnet test --filter Category=Integration
```


## Main Workflow
### 1) Create Order

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant GatewayService
    participant CartService
    participant OrderService
    participant DeliveryService
    participant NotificationService
    participant PaymentService
    participant Stripe

    User->>GatewayService: REST - checkout
    GatewayService->>CartService: REST - checkout
    CartService->>OrderService: gRPC - create order
    OrderService->>DeliveryService: gRPC - create delivery
    DeliveryService-->>OrderService: deliveryId
    OrderService-)NotificationService: MassTransit - OrderCreated
    NotificationService->>User: SignalR - notify order created
    OrderService->>PaymentService: gRPC - create checkout URL
    PaymentService->>Stripe: API - create checkout session
    Stripe-->>PaymentService: checkoutUrl
    PaymentService-->>OrderService: checkoutUrl
    OrderService-->>CartService: orderId, deliveryId, checkoutUrl
    CartService-->>GatewayService: checkoutUrl
    GatewayService-->>User: checkoutUrl
```

### 2) Successful Payment

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant GatewayService
    participant PaymentService
    participant OrderService
    participant NotificationService
    participant Stripe

    User->>Stripe: pays via checkoutUrl
    Stripe-->>PaymentService: Webhook - payment success
    PaymentService-)OrderService: MassTransit - PaymentSucceeded
    OrderService-->>OrderService: update status = Paid
    OrderService-)NotificationService: MassTransit - OrderStatusChanged
    NotificationService->>User: SignalR - notify order Paid
```
